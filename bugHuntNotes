Making sense of the bug
Letâ€™s break down what happens step by step.

Snake is moving to the left

Horizontal velocity, dx is equal to -10
main function is called
advanceSnake is called which advances the snake -10px to the left.
The player presses the down arrow key

changeDirection is called
keyPressed === DOWN_KEY && dy !goingUp evaluates to true
dx changes to 0
dy changes to +10
Player immediately presses the right arrow (before 100ms have lapsed)

changeDirection is called
keyPressed === RIGHT_KEY && !goingLeft evaluates to true
dx changes to +10
dy changes to 0
The game ends

main function is called after 100ms have lapsed.
advanceSnake is called which advances the snake 10px to the right.
const didCollide = snake[i].x === snake[0].x && snake[i].y === snake[0].y evaluates to true
didGameEnd returns true
main function returns early
The game ends
