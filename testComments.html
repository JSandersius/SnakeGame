    //for snake to work, we need to know the location of it
    //to do this, we can represent the snake as an array of coordinates
    //to create a snake in the middle of the canvas 150,150 


    //the users score

    //when set to true the snake is chaning direction

    //food x coordinate

    //food y coordinate

    // Horizonal velocity

    //vertivcal valocity

    //Get the canvas element using the id gameCanvas we specified earlier. 

    //then return the canvas “2d” context, which means we will be drawing into 2D space.

    //START GAME

    //create the first food location 

    //call changeDirection whenever the key is pressed 

    //* Main function of the game
    //* called repeatedly to advance the game

        //if the game ended return early to stop game 


    //Change the background coloe of the canvas to CANVAS_BACGROUND and 
    //draw a border around it
    //

        //select the color to fill the canvas

        //select the colour for the border of the canvas

        // Draw a "filled" rectangle to cover the entire canvas

        // Draw a border around the entire canvas

    //DRAW FOOD ON CANVAS

    // * ADVANCES the snake by changing the x-coordinates of its parts
    // * according to the horizontal velocity and the y - coordinates of its parts
    //  * according to the vertical veolocity

        //creates the new snakes head

        // add the new head to the beginning of snake body


            //increase score

            //display score on screen

            //Generate new food location

            //remove the last part of the body


    //returns true of the head of the snake touched another part of the game or any of the walls


    //Generates a random number that is a multiple of 10 given a minimum and a maximum number
    // @param  { number } min - minimum number the radnom number can be   
    // @param  { number } min - minimum number the radnom number can be 



    //Creates ransom set of coordinates for the snake food. 

        //generate a random number the food x-coordinate

        //generate a random number the food y-coordinate

        //if the new food location is where the snake property currently is, generate a new location


    //CREATING AND DRAWING THE SNAKE  
    // to display the snake on the canvas, we can write a function to draw a rectangle for each pair of coordinates

        //loop through the snake parts drawing each part on canvas


    //Draws a part of the snake on canvas
    //@param { object } snakePart - coordinates where tha part should be drawn

        //set the color of the snake 

        //set the border colour of the snake 

        //Draw  filled rectangle to represent the snake a the coordinates
        // the part is located

        //Draw a border around the snake


    //changes the vertical and horizonal velocity of the snake accoring to the key that was pressed
    //direction cannot be swithed to the oppisite direction, to prevent the snake from reversing
    //for example, if the direction is "right" it cannot become "left"
    // @param  object  event - the keydown event

        /**
         * Prevent the snake from reversing
         * Example scenario:
         * Snake is moving to the right. User presses down and immediately left
         * and the snake immediately changes direction without taking a step down first
